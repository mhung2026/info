# Hung Ngo Minh - Personal Portfolio

This repository contains a static website showcasing information about Hung Ngo Minh.

## Overview

The main page `index.html` presents several sections such as **About Me**, **My Skills** and **Contact Info**.  It loads styles and scripts from the `assets/` folder which includes Bootstrap, Font Awesome, jQuery and other libraries.

The portfolio highlights skills with technologies like .NET Core, SQL Server, ReactJS and NestJS. A downloadable resume can be found at `assets/file/HungNgoMinh_SE.pdf`.

## Running locally

You can open `index.html` directly in a browser. For a live development setup, the repo includes a `.vscode/settings.json` file that sets the Live Server extension port to `5501`.
